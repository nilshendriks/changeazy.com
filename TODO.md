“As a side project, I designed and developed a product site for a fictional bike brand based on a real gear concept. I chose Astro with Vue for performance and flexibility, used SCSS for styling, and built a modular, CMS-like content system using Astro collections. I focused on component structure, responsive design, and content modeling — all aligned with the kind of workflow your team values.”
