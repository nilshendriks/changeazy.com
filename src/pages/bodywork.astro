      <!-- <p>Unlike other manual therapies, The Perry Method avoids physical stress and discomfort; instead, it emphasizes ease of movement through the somatic three planes of motion to support healing and integration. Through choreographed mindful movements you will gain a deeper understanding of your body. This leads to heightened mindfulness and self-awareness. A healthier mind and body is a side effect.</p> -->
